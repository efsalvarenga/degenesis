Over the past decade, the relentless advance of the spore fields from the east of Pollen has placed your ancestral homeland in grave danger. The once plentiful taiga and tundra have become battlegrounds, threatened not only by the deadly spores but also by the encroaching Ironclaw Horde, led by the fearsome warlord Kargan the Bloodthirsty. The Lesnje, the whispering guardians of the woods, have grown increasingly aggressive, tipping the natural balance into chaos. Following a brutal Ironclaw raid that resulted in the abduction of five Vostok women, Elder Mirova calls for a council. The clan’s shamans, led by Yelena the Seer, have had disturbing visions of a cataclysmic future. The council places its hope in a perilous journey to find a new homeland. Rumours speak of a valley South of the ruins of Kiev where the Taiga is strong and rivers are clean. You have been chosen to be scouts on this endeavour, tasked with mapping the path to this promised land, seeking alliances with other clans and tribes along the way. But before the scouts departure, the tribe needs to make sure the Ironclaw does not pose significant threat to the remaining clanners. The first mission is to identify the Ironclaw’s hiding place, and gather with the other scouts 4 days later. The Vostok Kin Location Approximately 600 km east of the ruins of Kiev. Environment Tundra (and Taiga in the south), now increasingly encroached upon by spore fields from the east History The Vostok Kin trace their lineage back to survivors who fled eastward during the early days of the Eschaton. Initially, they found refuge in the dense forests and open steppes, where they developed a semi-nomadic lifestyle centred around hunting, foraging, and small-scale agriculture. Culture The Vostok Kin are a deeply spiritual people with a rich oral tradition. They believe their ancestors were guided by the spirits of the land to their current home, and they have a strong connection to nature. Their society is organised around extended family units, with elders holding significant influence. Spirituality They worship a pantheon of nature spirits, each associated with different aspects of their environment, such as whispers, weather and animals. Rites of Passage Important milestones in a Vostok Kin’s life are marked by elaborate ceremonies that often involve tests of skill and endurance. Includes the Rite of the Transcend Spore, when Primer Spores are consumed ritualistically. Conflict Resolution Disputes are settled through council meetings where elders mediate and seek the wisdom of the spirits. 1.1 Scouts departure Summary to be added after first session.
