Over the past decade, the relentless advance of the spore fields from the east of Pollen has placed their ancestral homeland in grave danger. The once plentiful taiga and tundra have become battlegrounds, threatened not only by the deadly spores but also by the encroaching Ironclaw Horde, led by the fearsome warlord Kargan, the Bloodthirsty. The Lesnje, the whispering guardians of the woods, have grown increasingly aggressive, tipping the natural balance into chaos. Following a brutal Ironclaw raid that resulted in the abduction of five Vostok women, Elder Mirova calls for a council. The clan’s shamans, led by Yelena, the Seer, have had disturbing visions of a cataclysmic future. The council places its hope in a perilous journey to find a new homeland. Rumours speak of a valley south of the ruins of Kiev where the taiga is strong and rivers are clean. Scouts have been chosen for this endeavour, tasked with mapping the path to this promised land, seeking alliances with other clans and tribes along the way. 1.1 In the spore wall A small detachment of scouts departs to discover the fate and location of the abducted women. Their number includes Jacob, Yuri, Skittle, Luna and Dr. Sofia Markov. Skittle and Yuri are cousins, and Yuri’s beloved, Julia, is among the missing. Luna, a young spiritual adherent, is also deeply affected by the abductions, as her mother, Emenem, was taken. Jacob, a decisive man of action, assumes the role of the group’s protector, while Dr. Sofia, a self-proclaimed PhD, brings a semblance of reason to the eclectic assembly. The third missing woman is Valissa. Following a ceremonial ritual, in which spores are cooked and prepared into small pouches for future use, the scout detachment steels itself for the journey ahead. Opting for an unexpected route, they venture through the perilous Spore Wall, a daring decision intended to evade the Ironclaw raiders who likely guard the more obvious southern approach to their lair. Once inside the wall, they navigate softer paths and uncover hidden openings, their progress both cautious and swift. One night, they find themselves beneath a magnificent aurora borealis, a rare and wondrous sight that fills them with a renewed sense of purpose. The next day, Jacob discovers a new path, but a sudden torrent of rain threatens to drench them. They seek refuge by climbing the mycelium-covered matter, avoiding the worst of the downpour. Upon reaching the ruins of Kramatorsk, Dr. Sofia uncovers books, remnants of knowledge from a bygone era. Yuri, exploring a basement, encounters a child and his father, scrape traders who deal in ancient artefacts, selling them to Chroniclers for a currency known as Drafts. These traders reveal they hail from a place called Shard. The group then moves southwest, traversing old metro and sewage tunnels, a testament to the world that once was. In the tunnels, they come across two inebriated Ironclaw raiders. Seizing the opportunity, they easily subdue them. Under mounting stress, a disagreement arises regarding the fate of the raiders. The argument escalates, culminating in the violent deaths of both captives. "],["directory.html", "A Directory A.1 People A.2 Factions A.3 Locations", " A Directory Directory.

A.2.1 Ironclaw Horde A.2.2 Vorstok’s Kin Size 100 people. Location Approximately 600 km east of the ruins of Kiev. Environment Tundra (and Taiga in the south), now increasingly encroached upon by spore fields from the east History The Vostok Kin trace their lineage back to survivors who fled eastward during the early days of the Eschaton. Initially, they found refuge in the dense forests and open steppes, where they developed a semi-nomadic lifestyle centred around hunting, foraging, and small-scale agriculture. Culture The Vostok Kin are a deeply spiritual people with a rich oral tradition. They believe their ancestors were guided by the spirits of the land to their current home, and they have a strong connection to nature. Their society is organised around extended family units, with elders holding significant influence. Spirituality They worship a pantheon of nature spirits, each associated with different aspects of their environment, such as whispers, weather and animals. Rites of Passage Important milestones in a Vostok Kin’s life are marked by elaborate ceremonies that often involve tests of skill and endurance. Includes the Rite of the Transcend Spore, when Primer Spores are consumed ritualistically. Conflict Resolution Disputes are settled through council meetings where elders mediate and seek the wisdom of the spirits.

The Terran Engine is self contained in this section, and will not require reading the SRD separately. Taxonomy “You” and “Your” are used interchangeably to refer to players and their characters. For disambiguation “Player(s)” is used when referring to the player outside the context of their character. “Challenge” is used to represent anything that is antagonistic to you, be that an NPC, the environment, etc. Meta game concepts, stats and currencies are marked as italic. Book references are marked in code, they might be accompanied by page ranges. Requirements Degenesis Rebirth, which can be obtained at no cost from the Degenesis website: Primal Punk DR1 Katharsys DR2 The Metamorphica (Classic Edition), which can be acquired as pay-what-you-want MORPH Light and Dark Dice B.1 Characters With the other players, define a cohesive group concept. Always start with a Name and Archetype. Roll for Attributes and assign points. Roll for Grit and Ego. Choose one Advancement. A character sheet is available here. B.1.1 Archetypes You are defined by your Culture, Clan and Concept. Together they define your Archetype. The Archetype encapsulates your background, concept, role and community within the narrative. It should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond your initial Archetype, towards unique narratives. DR2 34-41 Example: Who is Scuff Meet Scuff, our example character. Because the group is playing in the Balkan region, Scuff took that as a Culture. The group also agreed to play as a scouting detachment, and most of them are Clanners, although one is a Scraper - but not Scuff. Scuff is intended to be a believer in spirits, so their concept is that of a Zealot. B.1.2 Attributes There are \\(6\\) Attributes that you can use to overcome obstacles. Intuition: track targets, understand creatures, care, survive. Reason: concentrate, think abstractly, build knowledge. Finesse: dextrous manipulation, precision, subtle misdirection. Exertion: apply physical force and power, melee. Attunement: get in the flow and tune the arcane or technology. Influence: compel obedience, socialise, influence. Each Attribute has a rating (from \\(0\\) to \\(4\\)) that determine how many dice to roll when performing Risky Actions. On the character sheet, their ratings are read horizontally. Saves are groupings of two Attributes each. Insight/Reflexes Save groups Intuition and Reason Attributes Prowess/Fortitude Save groups Finesse and Exertion Attributes Resolve/Willpower Save groups Attunement and Influence Attributes Saves also have ratings (from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\)) that determine how many dice to roll in a Reaction situation. On the character sheet, their ratings are read vertically. Determine ratings For each Save grouping (Insight, Prowess, and Resolve) roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below to determine how many rating points you have to distribute for each. \\(1:3\\) \\(4:5\\) \\(6\\) Rating points \\(1\\) \\(2\\) \\(3\\) In certain conditions, you might permanently lose ratings, this is discussed in other sections. Example: Scuff’s ratings Scuff has an Attunement Attribute rating of \\(3\\) (read horizontally). They roll \\(3d\\) when performing a Risky Action related to Attunement. They also have Influence \\(0\\) (horizontally), so they roll \\(0d\\) (i.e. no chance if no advantage is found). If their Resolve is challenged, they may roll a Reaction with \\(1d\\), based on their Resolve/Willpower Save rating (read vertically). B.1.3 Grit &amp; Ego “It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward” (Rocky Balboa) While Grit represents your disposition, Ego represents your resilience to keep pushing. Roll \\(1d\\) to determine your Grit and Ego. Advancements and conditions may change the number of dice you roll. Wounds You lose Grit when you are harmed. When your Grit reaches \\(0\\) you start marking Wound tracks. You have \\(3\\) Wound tracks: Stressed (\\(-1d\\) Insight), Broken (\\(-1d\\) Prowess) and Weary (\\(-1d\\) Resolve). When all three Wound tracks are marked, you become Mortally Wounded. While Mortally Wounded you cannot gather Light Die for your Risky Actions. You will die instantly if harmed further, or in minutes if not attended to. If you survive being Mortally Wounded, you develop a Malaise. Roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below. With the GM, describe it narratively. Malaises \\(1\\) No Malaise. \\(2\\) \\(-1\\) Prowess, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(3\\) \\(-1\\) Insight, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(4\\) \\(-1\\) Resolve, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(5\\) When you re-roll your Ego, use \\(-1d\\) from now on. You die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(6\\) Re-roll your Grit with \\(-1d\\) from now on. You die if it goes below \\(0d\\). After a well fed and rested night, you roll and reset your Grit (\\(1d\\)). If you did not rest well you have \\(-1d\\) to roll for Grit. Each Wound track recovers through appropriate care and a week of rest. A Malaise never recovers. Pushing yourself You spend Ego when you push beyond yourself in Risky Actions or use some character Advancements. When your Ego reaches \\(0\\) you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. You may choose to consume Primer spores (or drugs based on these spores) to roll and reset your Ego (\\(1d\\)). Consult the highest value of your roll on the table below. Outcome \\(1:3\\) Reset your Ego to \\(1:3\\). You gain a Stigma. DR2 \\(4:5\\) Reset your Ego to \\(4:5\\), and roll a detrimental mutation. MORPH 127-129 \\(6\\) Reset your Ego to \\(6\\), and roll a random mutation. MORPH 124-129 These are the Primer slowly developing you into a Homo Degenesis. With the GM, determine the mechanical effects and how to introduce your mutation into the narrative. Example: Scuff’s scuffs Scuff has \\(1d\\) for both Grit and Ego (usual for early characters). They have seen some harm, having lost \\(3\\) Grit (from \\(5\\) to \\(2\\)) and taken a Hazed wound. This means that any time they roll related to Insight (Intuition or Reason for Risky Actions, or Evasion Reaction), they take \\(-1d\\). Scuff also risked their Ego a few times, and took Spores to reset it (from 2 to 4). They have taken a mutation, which is detailed as a Condition. Finally, they have gotten a malaise at some point, having reduced their Exertion Attribute rating because of a weakened lower back. B.1.4 Advancements As you become more seasoned, you gain Advancements. You start the game with \\(1\\) Advancement. Many Advancements in this section are adaptations of Degenesis’ Potentials. These will be accompanied by book reference tags. For every session you play (and survive) you gain \\(+2\\) Experience. You also gain \\(+1\\) Experience for each new Condition you develop. Whenever it is narratively coherent, you may spend Experience equal to \\(2\\times\\) your current number of Advancements to gain a new one. As you do that, you may reset your Grit maximum. Roll your dice and keep the maximum between the current and the new Grit. Until you have \\(5\\) Advancements, you can only choose from your own Cult or from the common list. Common Asceticism You do not take \\(-1d\\) when rolling for Grit while poorly fed. DR2 98 Bodyguard You can choose to take damage instead of one of your allies. Brainwave Roll Attunement. It you Succeed, you gain \\(+1d\\) when you try to find a solution to a problem, until the end of the scene. If you Fail, you become Hazed. DR2 98 Could be worse When Broken you do not take the penalty of \\(-1d\\). DR2 99 Danger sense \\(+1d\\) whenever you use a Insight/Evasion Save. DR2 98-99 Developed Gain \\(1\\) in an Attribute. The maximum you can have in all Attributes together is \\(10\\). Die Hard When you reset your Grit, roll \\(+1d\\) and sum all the dice you rolled. Eager When you reset your Ego, roll \\(+1d\\) and keep the highest. Elephant skin When unarmored your Armour is \\(1\\). DR2 98 Ether call \\(+1d\\) when interacting with other mutants (including combat). You must have at least \\(5\\) mutations to take this Advancement. DR2 98 Fast When you roll, your Effect is always applied first. Marathon \\(+1d\\) when running. DR2 99 Number cruncher \\(+1d\\) when using mathematics or logic. DR2 99 Sensory acuity You have \\(+1d\\) on noticing things through a chosen sense. Sleek \\(+1d\\) whenever you contort yourself to to break free. DR2 99 Specialist Choose a specific type of action. When you Fail it in a Risky Actions you still succeed, with Reduced Effect. For a list of specialisations, use Degenesis’ skills list. DR2 17-23 Unyielding When Weary you do not take the penalty of \\(-1d\\). DR2 99 Whirlwind In combat, when you are successful, select an additional die as a second hit. Chroniclers Dead End \\(+1d\\) when attacking someone cornered. DR2 53 Download \\(+1d\\) when questioning a prisoner NPC. DR2 53 Fractal Memory \\(+1d\\) on memory related actions. DR2 53 Nova Roll Attunement. It you Succeed, cause blindness until the end of the scene. If you Fail, the suit power is depleted until the end of the scene. DR2 53 Tesla \\(+1d\\) when in close contact conflict. If you Fail, roll \\(2d\\) effect as you electrocute yourself. DR2 53 Upload \\(+1d\\) when trying to incept an idea on an NPC. DR2 53 B.1.5 Equipment With the GM define which tags, ranges and Effect are appropriate for your weapons. Weapons used outside their expected ranges roll with \\(-1d\\). The following short list of tags may be expanded with the GM. Versatile: \\(+1e\\) when held two-handed. Nimble: Effect is applied first. Slaughter: Effect die explode on \\(5+\\). Improvised: \\(-1d\\), \\(1e\\). Unhandy: \\(-1d\\) if used at Contact or Reach ranges. Weapon Effect Ranges Tags Notes Knife \\(2e\\) Contact Nimble Staff \\(2e\\) Contact; Reach - Primitive bow \\(3e\\) Nearby Unhandy Short sword \\(3e\\) Contact Versatile Long sword \\(4e\\) Contact Versatile Hunting rifle \\(5e\\) Nearby; Far Away - Armours act as buffers when you take damage from Challenges. Subtract the armour modifier from the Effect before reducing your Grit Armour Modifier Details Light \\(-1e\\) Heavy \\(-2e\\) \\(-1d\\) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. Shield \\(-1e\\) Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an Effect. B.2 Rules B.2.1 Risky Actions When you are trying your chances at a Risky Action, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate Attribute or Save. Then gather 6-sided dice. Dice Pool Take a number of Light Dice equal to your applicable Attribute or Save. If you are in an advantageous or precarious position, the GM may give you \\(\\pm d\\). You must always roll between \\(0d\\) and \\(4d\\) Light Dice. Take as many Dark Dice as you wish to risk Ego for pushing yourself for a success. For each Dark Die that rolls equal or lower than your current Ego, decrease your Ego in one. Roll the dice and choose one die to be your Precision (generally the highest, but you might choose differently if you wish) and consult the table. Outcome \\(1:3\\) You Fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe the consequences. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. \\(4:5\\) You Succeed, but there’s some consequences. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed. \\(6\\) You Succeed. With the GM describe what happens. Evaluate Effects as appropriate, if the Risky Action is part of a Challenge. Effects Effects determines the quantitative result of your Risky Actions towards overcoming Challenges. Examples of Effects are: Damage given, Convincing done, Distance covered, Weakness learned. When you roll your Risky Actions, choose one die to be your Effect (generally the second highest, if the highest was used as Precision). The Effect die is an exploding die (i.e. if the result is a \\(6\\), keep rolling and accumulating the result). The Effect you apply is never lower than the Effect Tier of your approach, regardless of the die outcome. Your Effect is subtracted from the Challenge Disposition. Tier Minimum Effect for \\(1e\\)Improvised Makeshift tool;Rock, pipe, punch. \\(2e\\)Reduced Primitive tool;Weak argumentKnife, staff \\(3e\\)Standard Fit for purpose tool;Good argument; Revolver, short sword \\(4e\\)Increased Expert grade tool;Strong rationale;Autofire pistol, SMG, shotgun, long sword \\(5e\\)Extreme Tech augmented expert grade tool;Rifle, axe, halberd Challenges Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome Challenges. Examples of Challenges are fighting an enemy, duelling rhetorically, negotiating an environment, crawling a location, journeying. Challenges have Disposition, which measures how much Effect they take to be overcame. Challenges also have Effect dice that are applied to you as consequences of your Risky Actions. Tier Disposition Effect Examples \\(0\\)Trivial \\(5\\) \\(d/2\\) Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey \\(1\\)Dangerous \\(10\\) \\(1d\\) Skilled adversaries, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey \\(2\\)Serious \\(20\\) \\(2d\\) Expert adversaries, large predator, traverse fire or acid \\(3\\)Formidable \\(30\\) \\(3d\\) Human prime, apex predator, climbing the Everest \\(4\\)Exceptional \\(40+\\) \\(4d+\\) Transhuman, often fatal environments, heroic journeys Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous Challenge to fight against, but a Trivial Challenge to be convinced to ignore you. When Challenge Effects are applied to you narratively, use the table. Consequence \\(1:3\\) Something annoying happens. \\(4:5\\) Something troublesome happens. \\(6\\) Something devastating happens. When Challenge Effects are applied to you as damage your Grit might be reduced. Subtract the armour rating from the Effect, and then reduce the remainder from your Grit. B.2.2 Fortune die When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll \\(1d\\). B.2.3 Sayonara At any moment you can decide it is your last scene. When you do that, re-roll your Ego and Grit, and keep the highest values. For this scene, you only expend Ego if you roll a \\(1\\). By the end of the scene, you have to figure out how you depart (death, madness, mission, etc.). You can create a new character with half (rounded up) the number of Advances the previous character had. B.3 Social contract Define a social contract on the first session, and review it anytime a new player joins the table.
